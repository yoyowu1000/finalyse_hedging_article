# Hedging Liability Cashflows with Python: A Concise Guide

## Why Hedging is Necessary

typically, we take a risk where we want to achieve profits. and for insurance companies or for certain lines of business, we want to hedge out the risks that we believe won't create appropriate risk-adjusted returns. a clear example of this is interest rate risk for certain life insurance companies, where we sell annuities but don't want to take on the risk or market risk from investing in annuity funding.

## Why hedge programmatically

hedging programmatically helps us create a model that will help us understand how assets and liabilities relate to each other. with Python, it is relatively easier compared to other programming languages, and can help us sense-check results from other more sophisticated hedging applications, or simply create a script that we can run periodically to determine the appropriate hedging portfolio for say a small book of liabilities

## Python Prerequisites & Limitations

### Requirements

**What You Need:**

- Python 3.10+ environment
- Historical yield curve data
- Bond universe details (maturities, coupons)

**What This Example Doesn't Handle:**

- Credit risk (default probability)
- Callable or convertible bonds
- Multi-currency portfolios
- Liquidity constraints
- Non-parallel yield curve shifts (requires convexity adjustments)

## Core Concepts That Are Relevant

### Understanding the Building Blocks

in our example, we'll focus more on duration, as specifically macauly duration, to match our liabilities and assets. 

although not precise, duration can be seen as the sensitivity of your portfolio relative to interest rate changes. for example, a 5-year duration means that a 1% increase causes approximately 5% portfolio value loss

we also examine convexity, and convexity helps us understand the nonlinear relationship of our portfolio's price change relative to interest rate changes. in other words, it helps correct our assumption that prices change linearly when they don't

## Getting Started with the Code

To begin hedging with Python, we'll use the example code from `examples/insurance_company.py`. Here's how we structure the key components:

**Creating Liabilities:**

```python
liabilities = [
    Liability(time_years=1, amount=1_000),  # €1M in 1 year
    Liability(time_years=5, amount=2_500),  # €2.5M in 5 years
    Liability(time_years=10, amount=3_200), # €3.2M in 10 years
]
```

**Defining Available Bonds:**

```python
bonds = [
    Bond(maturity_years=2, coupon_rate=0.025, face_value=1),
    Bond(maturity_years=5, coupon_rate=0.032, face_value=1),
    Bond(maturity_years=10, coupon_rate=0.038, face_value=1),
]
```

**Running the Optimization:**

```python
optimizer = HedgingOptimizer(liabilities, bonds, yield_curve)
result = optimizer.duration_matching()
```

The code handles all the calculations and returns optimal bond quantities that minimize interest rate risk.

## Conclusion

Interest rate hedging isn't optional in today's volatile environment. With the code snippets above that can be found in the repo, you now have a starting point to implement hedging that reduces risk while potentially saving significant regulatory capital. The code can be further enhanced to your organisational or personal requirements.
